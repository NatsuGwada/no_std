Matière programmation Rust Systeme


Consigne: 
● Git repo, add me as contributor

● The project is in no_std

● Commit are looked at, do not commit everything in one time, else it’s
considered cheating

●If you take code from somewhere it has to be credited,else considered
cheating as well

● Code quality (miri/mirai/fuzzers, other cargo utils ….) are bonus but testing
is MANDATORY

● Unsafe must be thoroughly documented using rustdoc safety part

●Comment your code and use rust doc, code exemple are
appreciated for the allocation library

●test your program you can use test_runner 

● No group, is to be done individually

● A report with your design choice is needed, slab allocators can
be a hard thing to do, so I need to understand what you wanted
to do in the first place
